## Validation Commands

### Environment Validation
```bash
# Check Warp Terminal
warp --version

# Check Git
git --version

# Check Docker (if needed)
docker --version

# Check kubectl (if needed)
kubectl version --client

# Check Node.js (if needed)
node --version
```

### Repository Validation
```bash
# Check repository structure
ls -la tiation-terminal-workflows/

# Check workflows directory
ls -la ~/.warp/workflows/

# Test Git access
git ls-remote git@github.company.com:company/terminal-workflows.git
```

### Security Validation
```bash
# Run security scan
bash scripts/security-scan.sh

# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|token" specs/ --include="*.yaml"

# Validate YAML syntax
find specs/ -name "*.yaml" -exec yamllint {} \;
```

### Integration Validation
```bash
# Test Slack integration
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"Test message"}' \
  $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

# Test monitoring endpoints
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://prometheus.company.com:9090

# Test JIRA integration
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $JIRA_AUTH" \
  "https://company.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/myself"
```
